#### about Me
## my intrests
# I like to do pottery & wood working as I've said before and hang out with my friends when I have free time. My favorite subject is English because the teacher we have here is well-spoken & intresting and the class itself is good and challenging.
## websites I recommend:
- [BlackBoard] (https://blackboard.waketech.edu/ultra/stream) - Of course I would recommend my college class accessed website to get into this class in CTI.
- [YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/) - On an actual note, I'd recommend youtub since I like to watch it wtih no ads with elizabeth since she has an adblocker and it's fun to watch videos with her.
